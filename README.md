## Course description

There is a wide range of cognitive tasks used by researchers studying
cognitive development that tap into different cognitive abilities and
skills (e.g., intelligence, working memory, inhibitory control). Typical
measures of executive functions used with school-aged children are the
Dimensional Change Card Sort, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test,
Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale (5th Edition). Along with the above
tests, reaction times have been shown to correlate with cognitive
executive functions. This is particularly true for reaction times tasks
such as the Stroop Task, and the Stop Signal Task. During this session,
we will discuss the theory behind the tasks and key practical and
methodological challenges.

The lecture consists of three parts

1.  Cognition and cognitive tests

2.  Reaction Times: subtraction method and drift-diffusion model

3.  Link between reaction times and cognition
