# Reaction times are related to cognitive functions

</br>
</br>
* Robust evidence for a clear relationship between RT and cognitive functions 

* The association between RT and cognition is stronger for more complex tasks

* Brain diseases (e.g. Parkinson's, schizophrenia) and developmental disorders (e.g. ADHD, autism) are characterised by altered performance in various RT tasks

# The Stroop test

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Stroop effect]
.pull-left[
**Task:** Override the impulse to read a word out loud and instead indicate the color of the word.

** The Stroop Effect** : longer reaction times for color identification in incongruent trials compared to congruent trials.

** Interpretation**: Fast, automatic process of reading the word interferes with the relatively slower, non-automatic, process of identifying the colour of the text (Stroop, 1935).

Stroop task performance explained by changes in drift-rate (Gajewski et al., 2020).

Relies on the anterior cingulate cortex.

* RT to Stroop tasks decreases systematically from early childhood through early adulthood:

  - Speed of processing increases with age
  
  - Cognitive control becomes increasingly efficient
  
* Age-related changes associated with developemnet in various domains:
  
  - .red[**Working memory**]
  - .red[**Inhibitory control**], fundamental to regulate behaviour (e.g. overcome the automatic reflex to read the work to report the color of the letters)

# The Stop-Signal task
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Inhibitory control]
.pull-left[
**Task:** Respond as quickly as possible to a given stimulus (**go trial**). Abort any response when a subsequently presented **stop signal** is presented.

 </br> 
  </br> 

**Interpretation**: A race between a go process, triggered by the go stimulus, and a stop process, triggered by the stop signal. 

When the stop process reaches the boundary before the go process, the response is inhibited (*independent race*).

Relies on cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamocortical circuits

* The ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response improves with age during childhood (4-12 years).

* Error monitoring (i.e. slowing down on trial following errors) emerges around 6 years.

* Inhibition measures derived from the task correlate with teachers rating of inattention.

* Poor inhibitory control in adult with ADHD associated with slow 'stop process': selective deficit in inhibition.

* Children with ADHD associated show slow 'stop' and 'go' processes: general deficit in cognitive control.
